[Music]

2
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,119
well

3
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,480
i welcome you all to the lecture four of

4
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,840
week five

5
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,440
in this week we will be studying the

6
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,040
important building block

7
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,520
of an automated system that is

8
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,320
microprocessor technology

9
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,640
let us look at the outline of this

10
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,760
lecture

11
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,559
at start of the lecture we will see the

12
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:49,760
definition of

13
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,960
a microprocessor

14
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,320
then we will see its architecture

15
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,600
it has various elements

16
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,640
how these elements operate

17
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,280
then we will learn what is the

18
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,560
difference between

19
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,320
a microcontroller and a microprocessor

20
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,799
the definition of microcontroller will

21
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,000
be studied

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,200
after that we will study

23
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,280
the microcomputers which we are using

24
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,840
for our regular day-to-day activities

25
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,119
at the end of the lecture we will study

26
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:32,000
about

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,720
the plcs the programmable logic

28
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,680
controllers

29
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,840
which are used in the automation

30
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,840
industry

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,640
its elements configuration and operation

32
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,479
will be studied in detail

33
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:51,040
fine let us begin in this lecture

34
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,240
we will be studying various programmable

35
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,200
logic devices

36
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,840
in a in our previous lectures we have

37
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,079
seen

38
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,479
the elements of measurement system

39
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,520
such as the sensors and

40
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,879
the signal conditioning devices

41
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:17,440
after that we have also seen how we can

42
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,520
convert the signals from one form to the

43
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,319
another form now let us look at

44
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,800
the fundamentals of programmable logic

45
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,360
devices

46
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,120
as the name suggests the programmable

47
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,319
logic devices

48
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,440
has two words

49
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,560
these are programmable and logic

50
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,080
the devices which are carrying out

51
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,840
logical operations on the data

52
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,319
are called as the logic devices

53
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,560
but when we are able to program them

54
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,879
when the users are able to program

55
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,760
these logic devices then we are call

56
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,879
them as

57
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,360
the programmable logic devices

58
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,720
programmable means

59
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,560
we can teach we can instruct

60
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,640
we can train these logic devices to

61
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,400
carry out

62
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,840
a certain set of instructions in

63
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,879
the given sequence

64
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,000
so what kind of operations these

65
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,760
programmable logical

66
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,799
logic devices are carrying out they are

67
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,000
carrying out various

68
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,120
control functions according to

69
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,720
the instructions written in its memory

70
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,319
so whatever the commands that we are

71
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,000
giving they are

72
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,760
the low level language commands

73
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,200
we will see what is the meaning of the

74
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,599
low level and the high level language

75
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,120
in the next few slides

76
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,480
the first pld is the microprocessor

77
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,599
microprocessor is a digital

78
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,720
integrated circuit it is

79
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,759
an electronic circuit and it carries out

80
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,639
various digital functions which are

81
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:21,600
necessary

82
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,479
to process the information which are

83
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,160
necessary

84
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,960
to process the data given to the

85
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,199
microprocessor

86
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,720
the microcomputer is

87
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,560
utilizing the microprocessor

88
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,600
as its cpu that is a central processing

89
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,520
unit

90
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,400
and it contains all functions of a

91
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,840
computer

92
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,120
so micro computer may have memory

93
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,000
it can communicate with the outside

94
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,880
world

95
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,479
with input output devices

96
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,120
so here you must know the difference

97
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:01,840
between

98
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,440
the processor and a computer processor

99
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,639
is a simple

100
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,360
circuit while computer is a system

101
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,320
it has processor as the cpu central

102
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,120
processing unit

103
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,120
third pld which is very

104
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,520
widely used which is very important as

105
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,160
far as

106
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,360
the automated system is concerned is

107
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,680
plc that is programmable logic

108
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,320
controller

109
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,360
programmable logic controller also

110
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,199
incorporates

111
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,639
the microprocessor as

112
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,440
the central processing unit and it

113
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,280
controls the operations

114
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,320
of electromechanical devices

115
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,919
but plc is working in very harsh

116
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:52,639
condition

117
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,440
so the construction of the plc must be

118
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,400
very rugged

119
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,199
very robust

120
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,080
the general microprocessors which are

121
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,720
used in

122
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,160
automation industry are the embedded

123
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,039
microprocessor

124
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,520
some of the features of this

125
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,000
microprocessor

126
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,280
are first

127
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,319
these kind of microprocessors are

128
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,400
dedicated to a specific function

129
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,039
control of a specific function for

130
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,039
example

131
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,840
we want to have an automatic control

132
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,240
system

133
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,440
to control the temperature of an

134
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,120
electric furnace

135
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,319
here the function is to control the

136
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,440
temperature of

137
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,800
the furnace if the temperature

138
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,599
if the inside temperature of the furnace

139
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,560
is above the set value

140
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,599
the microprocessor should cut off

141
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,319
the supply of electricity to that

142
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,560
electric furnace

143
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,000
so a simple electronic circuitry

144
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,639
which is embedded inside the electric

145
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:07,599
furnace

146
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,199
is nothing but the embedded

147
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,360
microprocessor

148
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,840
so it is dedicated to carry out specific

149
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,160
functions

150
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,000
second feature of the embedded

151
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,240
microprocessor is

152
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,520
they are self starting

153
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,759
so the processors are starting on their

154
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,360
own

155
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,639
as we switch on the system the processor

156
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:31,759
will start

157
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,560
on its own

158
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,599
why we are incorporating

159
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,400
the microprocessor is in automation as

160
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,280
we have seen

161
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,000
the definition of automation that we

162
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,879
want to

163
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,800
reduce the human intervention we want to

164
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,840
have no intervention

165
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,840
so to carry out the operations in auto

166
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,240
mode

167
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,319
we are taking help of the electronic

168
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,160
spec circuitry

169
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,400
that is nothing but the microprocessors

170
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:11,360
these are completely self-contained

171
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,080
the embedded microprocessor has their

172
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,360
own memory

173
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,319
has may have their own battery backup as

174
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,280
well

175
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,800
they may have their own energy source as

176
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,479
well

177
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,120
the microprocessor which are used in

178
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,080
automation

179
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,799
which are embedded in in the products or

180
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,080
systems

181
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,320
has their own operating system

182
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,479
so we can say an embedded microprocessor

183
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,920
will be dedicated to a specific function

184
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,680
it is self-starting it doesn't require

185
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,800
any human intervention

186
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,600
these are completely self-contained

187
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,920
everything is there inside the system

188
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,399
and they do have their own operating

189
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,800
system

190
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,880
the microprocessor a multi-purpose

191
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,440
programmable device

192
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,120
it basically reads the binary

193
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,440
instructions

194
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,360
from a storage device that called memory

195
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,480
the memory may be the temporary memory

196
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,440
or it may be

197
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,399
the permanent memory so whatever the

198
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,399
signals which are

199
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,839
getting in will be stored in a temporary

200
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,040
memory

201
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,160
the microprocessor process this

202
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,120
information

203
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,680
as per the need as per the instructions

204
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,640
given in the program

205
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,040
it process that information according to

206
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,200
the instructions

207
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,320
and it provides the results as

208
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,000
the output so getting

209
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,839
the information reading the information

210
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,000
and processing the information based

211
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,040
upon the instructions given

212
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,959
are the functions of a microprocessor

213
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:13,760
but how these functions are carried out

214
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,839
to carry out these functions the

215
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:18,240
microprocessor

216
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,079
basically has three elements

217
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,120
the processor memory element

218
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,800
and input output devices to carry out

219
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,480
these functions

220
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,519
the microprocessor basically has

221
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:38,160
hardware and this

222
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,839
and the hardware is nothing but the

223
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,200
electronic parts

224
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,480
which are integrated together to carry

225
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,120
out

226
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,800
the intended operation the processor is

227
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,880
an electrical circuitry

228
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,160
memory is an electronic part and

229
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,880
input output devices are are the

230
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,839
electromechanical

231
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:01,600
parts well these components are

232
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,279
integrated together

233
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,000
but their coordinated operation will be

234
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,519
carried out

235
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,800
by a set of instructions

236
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,880
and that of set of instruction is

237
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,560
nothing but the program

238
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,320
and when we group together

239
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,959
a variety of programs then we call that

240
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,519
as a

241
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,079
software

242
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,519
so let us see what this processor does

243
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,320
the processor recognizes the program

244
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,920
instructions

245
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,279
and it carry out it execute

246
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,240
that program instructions as per the

247
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,000
order given as per the sequence

248
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,920
given the microprocessor has the in

249
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,959
input output interfaces

250
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,720
so the microprocessor is also carrying

251
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,120
out the communication between

252
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,320
the cpu that is the processor and the

253
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,920
outside world

254
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,560
through the input output interfaces

255
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,880
so in general we call the interface as

256
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,440
port in our day to day language as well

257
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,720
we are using

258
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,040
the word port quite often

259
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,880
the third element which is there that is

260
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,880
a memory

261
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,160
the memory basically holds the program

262
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,920
instructions and the data

263
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,120
the applications of microprocessor can

264
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,040
be classified

265
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,240
basically in two categories so based

266
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,000
upon the applications of the

267
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,760
microprocessor

268
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,720
we can say that the microprocessor can

269
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,760
be utilized

270
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,240
as a reprogrammable system device

271
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,600
such as the microcomputer

272
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,360
so whatever the computing devices that

273
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,880
we do have

274
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,240
we can reprogram these systems we can

275
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,240
change its operating system

276
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,600
we can install some programs we can

277
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,639
modify

278
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,639
uh these programs we can edit the

279
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,200
programs

280
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,760
so to carry out these operations in

281
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,000
microcomputers

282
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,839
we are using the microprocessor

283
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,000
so when we are using the microprocessor

284
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,040
utility for developing the

285
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,600
reprogrammable system

286
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,440
that we call the application of

287
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,720
microprocessor

288
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,839
to have the microcomputers

289
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,040
in the second application we we want to

290
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:39,519
have

291
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,440
the dedicated functions that to be

292
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,560
carried out by the microprocessor

293
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,040
and these are nothing but the embedded

294
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,040
systems which we have already talked

295
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,360
about

296
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,320
let us consider the typical automated

297
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,360
system such as

298
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,240
a conveyor belt automated guided

299
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,240
vehicles

300
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,279
automatic furnaces

301
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,959
all the manufacturing industry equipment

302
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,120
whether it may be processing equipment

303
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,320
or it is

304
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,360
the conveying equipment or it is

305
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,160
the monitoring equipment so whenever we

306
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,680
are saying

307
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,160
we want to carry out the intended

308
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,320
application the desired application

309
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,920
in automatic mode there also

310
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,959
we need the microprocessor so the

311
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,199
application of microprocessor to carry

312
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,079
out

313
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:36,000
specific functions in automatic mode

314
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,320
that is nothing but the embedded system

315
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,839
these processors

316
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,199
do operate in binary digits that is

317
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:47,279
0 and 1 these digits are called bits

318
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,000
if the electrical voltage given to the

319
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,040
machine

320
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,199
is of low level then the bit would be 0

321
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,320
and if a high voltage is applied

322
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,519
high electrical energy is applied

323
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,199
then we are considering that as

324
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,160
the beat 1.

325
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,800
so when we group together these beads

326
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,920
a word is formed

327
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,839
and if the length of the word is 8 bits

328
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,040
then that

329
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,839
then we are calling that word as the

330
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,839
byte

331
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,519
if the word length is 4 then we are

332
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:32,959
calling that as

333
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,440
nibble

334
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,920
so as already i have talked to you a

335
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,920
command in binary

336
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,000
to accomplish a task is nothing but the

337
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,320
instruction

338
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,440
read write

339
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,279
add subtract

340
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,639
so so many operations the

341
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,440
microprocessors are carrying out

342
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,959
the command in binary to accomplish that

343
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:01,600
task

344
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,560
is nothing but the instructions that we

345
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,880
are giving to the microprocessor

346
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,160
so these instructions can be entered

347
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,880
either through input devices or they can

348
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,920
be stored

349
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,440
in the storage devices itself

350
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,920
so the instructions we can input by

351
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,199
using the keyboard

352
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,880
that is a very general input device that

353
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,000
we use

354
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,639
or we are using the pointing device and

355
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,079
clicking device

356
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,639
nothing but the pointer is nothing but

357
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,560
the mouse these are all

358
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,720
input devices but in in certain cases

359
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,000
the instructions are embedded they are

360
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,399
stored in the memory of the computer

361
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,800
itself

362
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,079
a typical architecture

363
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,199
of the microprocessor can be seen

364
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,880
on your screen so as i mentioned

365
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,040
it has the processor

366
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,079
the processor has three parts

367
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:12,480
first is arithmetic and logic unit

368
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:18,240
register arrays and the control unit

369
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,000
the second set of elements

370
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,760
is the input output devices

371
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,720
through which the microprocessors are

372
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,320
communicating with

373
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,440
the outside world

374
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,960
and the third element is the memory

375
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,840
so either we can have the read-only

376
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,559
memory

377
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,760
permanent memory or we can have

378
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,280
the random memory where we can read or

379
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:47,679
write

380
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:52,320
we can have the erasing operations

381
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,640
be possible so to communicate with these

382
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,240
input output devices

383
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,640
and the memory we required a mechanism

384
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,039
and that mechanism is nothing but the

385
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,120
communication mechanism

386
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,480
which is through the wires

387
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,919
through wires we are passing the

388
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,520
electrical signals

389
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,320
and a set of wires is nothing but the

390
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,600
bus through which

391
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,559
we are communicating with various

392
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,760
elements of the microprocessor

393
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,640
the resistor array has many resistors

394
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,080
and these resistors are

395
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,240
utilized as temporary memory locations

396
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,440
through which the microprocessor is

397
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,919
carrying out a variety of operations

398
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,080
what operations is it is carrying out it

399
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:42,960
is carrying out

400
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,240
the algebraic operations as well as the

401
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,000
logic operations so algebraic operations

402
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
are

403
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,280
the addition and subtraction and

404
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,520
the logic operations are and or

405
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,640
the input output devices are called the

406
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,520
peripherals

407
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,400
so when we have the central processing

408
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,200
unit

409
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,840
on a single chip that is called the

410
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,320
microprocessor

411
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,440
so as i mentioned the arithmetic and

412
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,799
logic unit

413
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,440
is carrying out the operations such as

414
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,840
addition

415
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,440
subtraction these are the algebraic

416
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,480
arithmetic

417
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,640
operations and the logic operations are

418
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,720
the and or operations

419
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,640
the register array is is having

420
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,080
a set of registers which are acting as

421
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,440
temporary storage devices so whatever

422
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:45,760
the

423
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,880
information we are getting from

424
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,480
the memory may be permanent or the

425
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,160
random access memory these information

426
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,080
will be stored in a temporary manner

427
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,240
inside the cpu itself

428
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,520
based on the control instructions

429
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,080
the microprocessor is taking this

430
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:10,960
information

431
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,840
which is at the temporary storage it

432
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,960
carries

433
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,799
out the arithmetic and logic operations

434
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,840
on this information which is

435
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,400
stored in the register arrays and it

436
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,760
further

437
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,320
gives the output which is stored in the

438
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,799
register array itself

439
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,679
so whatever the results are stored in

440
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,360
the register array

441
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,880
that will be taken through the bus

442
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,240
that will be communicated to the output

443
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,400
terminal if required or it will be

444
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,520
stored

445
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,120
inside the memory the control

446
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,760
unit is carrying out the controlling of

447
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,960
the signals or the data to

448
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,400
switch the data through the system bus

449
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,640
and apply the set of instructions

450
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,080
over the data would be controlled by

451
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,919
this control unit the timings will be

452
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:12,480
set

453
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,679
so it has a clock

454
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,200
it is nothing but a oscillator

455
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,520
oscillator circuit which we have seen in

456
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,320
our

457
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,159
the early lecture that is the

458
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,240
piezoelectric based

459
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,559
clocks the clocks are giving signals

460
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,280
the time has over now we have to execute

461
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,000
the next set of instruction

462
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,640
so accordingly the processor will take

463
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,679
the data

464
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,640
it will process the data and return the

465
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,360
data back to the register array

466
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,880
the peripherals the input

467
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,200
peripheral are nothing but

468
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,720
the keyboards or we can have

469
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,280
the adcs that is analog to digital

470
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,799
converters

471
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,919
we have seen in our previous class

472
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,240
that the analog to digital converters

473
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,480
are converting

474
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,679
the analog data into digital format

475
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,480
and that digital format data will be

476
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,480
given to the microprocessor

477
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,240
in case of it is used for the embedded

478
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,080
operations but if the microprocessor is

479
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:24,960
a part of a

480
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,679
microcomputer then we are inputting the

481
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:28,480
data

482
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,320
through the keyboard if

483
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,039
the microprocessor is utilized in a

484
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:40,320
microcontroller then the output would be

485
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,960
given to the actuating device

486
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,520
through the signal condition device such

487
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,720
as

488
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,720
dac that is a digital to analog

489
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,840
converter

490
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,960
but if it is a micro computer then the

491
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,080
output would be

492
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,600
simple display devices such as leds

493
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,640
crts or a printer or

494
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,919
a magnetic tape as i mentioned there are

495
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:06,640
two

496
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,720
types of memories are used that is a

497
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,240
read-only memory

498
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,919
and the random access memory

499
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,559
in read-only memory we are storing the

500
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,320
programs

501
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,080
which we cannot alter these are

502
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,200
the system programs which we are

503
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,240
storing the user cannot change the

504
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,080
programs

505
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,600
so some programs like the monitor

506
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,360
program

507
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,159
or the drivers of the hardware are

508
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,360
stored in

509
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,400
the read-only memory

510
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,799
the data on the random access memory can

511
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,120
easily be changed

512
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,400
here we are giving the data

513
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,440
that to be processed or even we can

514
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,480
have the programs that to be modify or

515
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,600
edit

516
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,240
so bus is nothing but a group of wires

517
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,600
which are used to

518
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,520
communicate the signals among the

519
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,600
various elements of

520
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,000
the microprocessor system after studying

521
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,559
the definition of a microprocessor

522
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:19,200
microcomputer now let us look at

523
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,600
the configuration of the microcomputer

524
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,880
on your screen you can see typical

525
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,159
arrangement of

526
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,799
a variety of elements of a microcomputer

527
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:36,000
so it has the alu

528
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,039
and control unit it has

529
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:43,679
the input output devices

530
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:48,720
these are the peripherals the memory

531
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,679
and various types of buses

532
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:57,039
these buses are carrying the digital

533
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,559
signals

534
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:03,200
from one section to another section

535
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,559
these are the paths through which we are

536
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:09,600
communicating either the data

537
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,720
related to the variable

538
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,080
the instructions to carrying out

539
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,640
the controlling operation or to

540
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,679
communicate

541
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:24,000
the address of the data

542
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,840
the bus is nothing but

543
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,200
collection of a number of parallel

544
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,760
conductors

545
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,840
these are carrying electrical signals

546
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,679
and these buses are being shared by

547
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:47,360
many chips which are integrated

548
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,480
in a typical micro computer so you

549
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,120
might have gone through various

550
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,159
configurations

551
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,360
of microcomputer

552
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,559
based upon the number of bits

553
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,960
so we can call a 16 bits configuration

554
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,080
or 32 bits configuration or

555
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:12,400
64 bits com configuration

556
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:17,039
the meaning is that we can handle

557
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:21,120
2 raised to power number of bits

558
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,440
values by using these

559
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,320
communication paths if the number of

560
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,600
bits are 16

561
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,640
that means we can handle 2 raised to

562
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,200
power

563
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,640
16 types of values by

564
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,240
using this communication path so as

565
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,440
the number of paths are more we can

566
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,279
have the faster communication

567
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,000
in earlier days there was a serial

568
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,240
communication in the microprocessor

569
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,679
the information or the instructions

570
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:59,840
used to pass in a sequential manner

571
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,000
so that's why the microprocessors were

572
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,080
very very slow

573
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,880
with the invention with the introduction

574
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,360
of

575
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,080
the parallel communication by using

576
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:10,799
these

577
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:14,400
wires now the microprocessors

578
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,679
are very fast very rapid

579
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:20,880
each path carries one bit of data

580
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,360
there are basically three types of buses

581
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,559
being used

582
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:28,159
in microprocessor or a micro computer

583
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:32,159
the first type of bus is the data bus

584
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,840
the data bus is associated with

585
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,760
processing of the information

586
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,240
if we are saying that there is a word

587
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,799
length of four bits

588
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:48,240
consider a word of one zero one zero

589
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,880
that means we require four parallel

590
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,399
wires

591
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:56,000
that to be laid down to communicate

592
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,760
this this word one zero one zero

593
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,279
so the number of values which can be

594
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:07,440
possible by using this 4 bit data bus

595
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,159
so we can have 2 raise to power 4 that

596
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:10,480
is

597
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,320
16 number of values can be handled by

598
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:18,480
this data so if you take example of a

599
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,880
embedded system which is used to

600
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,120
record forces and to process the

601
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,360
information about the forces

602
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,039
say automatic way balance machine

603
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:34,799
so when the force is in between

604
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:38,799
20 to 180 newton we are using this

605
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:42,159
device this is the the range of

606
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,760
the device is 22 or 80 newton

607
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:50,880
capacity the span would be 160

608
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,720
so as the number of values are only 16

609
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,480
so we can have only 16 segments

610
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,520
of the span so the 16 segments of the

611
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,600
span can be handled by

612
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,039
this microprocessor or the embedded

613
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,080
system

614
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,360
each segment may have a 10

615
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,640
newton of the capacity

616
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,399
the 4 bits type of data buses

617
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,960
or 4 bits type of the communication

618
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,240
systems

619
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,279
are quite often used in toys

620
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:28,559
so automatic toys very small

621
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,960
type of in very small variety of

622
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,159
information

623
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,120
we need to process but the general

624
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,559
computers that we are

625
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,880
using nowadays they do have the capacity

626
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,399
of 64 bit

627
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:43,919
maybe more than that

628
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,880
the next bus is the address bus it

629
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,320
carries the signal

630
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,440
which is indicating where the data

631
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,279
is to be find out so it carries

632
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:57,760
the location it carries the information

633
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,600
about the location of the data from

634
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,880
which we have to

635
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,679
fetch the data or we have to load the

636
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:04,159
data

637
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:05,679
or write the data in the memory

638
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,840
locations

639
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,960
select the certain memory location

640
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,240
at the input or output ports as well

641
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,279
it's not only getting the data from the

642
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:18,480
memory locations

643
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,840
at the memory in the memory each store

644
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,600
storage location has

645
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,320
a unique identification and that that

646
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,919
unique identification

647
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:32,159
is called the address the next type of

648
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:35,440
bus is the control bus

649
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,880
the control bus is carrying out

650
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,159
the signals related to the control

651
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:44,799
actions so what may be the control

652
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:45,520
action

653
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,840
say reading the data from the input

654
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,000
device

655
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,240
it's basically the function of

656
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,360
the microprocessor read the data

657
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,080
so it is controlling this operation

658
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,039
write the data

659
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:03,919
to the output device and this

660
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:05,600
controlling operations would be carried

661
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,720
out based upon

662
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,080
a clock the clock is nothing but

663
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,720
a crystal controlled oscillator which we

664
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,640
have already seen in our previous

665
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,080
lectures

666
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,960
it produces pulses at regular intervals

667
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,720
and based upon the

668
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,919
the clock signals

669
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:25,919
the control bus operations would be

670
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:27,120
carried out by

671
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,240
the microprocessor

672
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:34,960
well now see what are the various

673
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,720
programmable controllers which are based

674
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,360
upon

675
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,919
the mic processor in the industry

676
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:42,960
basically

677
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,279
plc's that is a programmable logic

678
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:46,320
controllers

679
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:50,640
and microcontrollers are often being

680
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:55,440
used these two devices

681
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,559
are incorporating microprocessor as

682
00:31:58,559 --> 00:31:59,360
their

683
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:03,440
cpu central processing unit

684
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,039
so what is the microcontroller the

685
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:06,640
microcontroller has

686
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,519
the central processor it has the memory

687
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:09,840
and

688
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,120
it has the input output ports so

689
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,960
together it is called as the

690
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,919
microcontroller

691
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,120
it is implementing

692
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,679
the functions of a computer and the

693
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:26,880
controller

694
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,519
but all these functions and all this

695
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:30,399
circuitry

696
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:34,080
is on a single chip that is

697
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,120
the uniqueness of the microcontroller

698
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,600
it is a very small device which can

699
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,399
easily

700
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:45,440
embed inside the equipment itself

701
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,880
so all the processing circuitry

702
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,240
memory and input output ports are

703
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,519
manufactured integrated on a single chip

704
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,840
itself

705
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,039
but the capability of microcontroller is

706
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:03,039
limited it is generally

707
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:05,840
programmed to carry out a few

708
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,880
applications

709
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,600
few operations a simple operation say

710
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,080
control

711
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,799
of temperature in in an electrical

712
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:14,559
furnace a simple operation

713
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:17,200
is there to control the temperature if

714
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:17,679
the

715
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:19,840
set temperature is more than then cut

716
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,440
off it

717
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,600
so for one or two applications the

718
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,440
microcontrollers are used

719
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,039
again i am giving the example of the

720
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:28,480
washing machine

721
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,120
so to control the operations of washing

722
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,720
machines which is having the limited

723
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,320
capability

724
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,440
we cannot change its program

725
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,440
it is dedicated to specific control

726
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,279
function

727
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:43,519
so generally microcontrollers are used

728
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,399
in automobiles

729
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:49,600
aircrafts and medical electronics

730
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,080
and majorly they are being used in the

731
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,360
home automation

732
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,399
home appliances

733
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,399
so as i mentioned they are very small

734
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:04,080
and can be embedded

735
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,600
in electromechanical system without

736
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,639
taking up much space

737
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:14,000
they are space effective very small

738
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,560
integrated compact devices

739
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,440
they need very little programmable

740
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,879
memory

741
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:26,560
memory is also required very less

742
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,520
so some of the standard microcontrollers

743
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,440
available in the market

744
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,320
uh can be seen on your screen these are

745
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,440
motorola

746
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,440
68 hd11 xylox

747
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,040
intel mcs51

748
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,240
and 96 series

749
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:49,199
the next type of controller is the

750
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:51,679
programmable logic controller

751
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:54,960
and it is often used in the

752
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,200
heavy industry heavy automation industry

753
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,400
we can say that any computer which is

754
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,359
having the

755
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:06,960
input output interface which can be used

756
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,440
to

757
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,880
communicate with the external devices

758
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,480
it's nothing but a programmable logic

759
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,280
controller but what is the difference of

760
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,880
a typical plc with

761
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,640
the micro controller or micro computer

762
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,160
is that

763
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,640
the computers or controllers are not

764
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,599
industrially

765
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:30,880
hardened they are not designed

766
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,560
to sustain in the harsh conditions

767
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,160
in the industry harsh conditions may be

768
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,560
very high currents high voltages

769
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,880
high temperature high humidity high

770
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,680
noise

771
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,720
vibrations so micro computers

772
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,760
may not sustain this harsh environment

773
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,680
so when we are designing spatial

774
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,240
microprocessor based device which will

775
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:56,880
sustain

776
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,119
all these harsh conditions that is

777
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:01,119
nothing but the programmable logic

778
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:03,599
controller

779
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:07,599
the plcs have electrically isolation

780
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,720
circuitry so we have seen one very

781
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,680
important

782
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,160
isolation circuitry that is a optical

783
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,920
isolators of toy

784
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,560
isolators

785
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,520
so these type of isolation circuitries

786
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,280
are

787
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,040
integrated in the plc to safeguard the

788
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,000
the circuitry of the plc from the

789
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,160
harmful signals

790
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,800
a typical definition of the plc can be

791
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,960
seen on your screen

792
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,359
it is a digital electronic device

793
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:46,079
it uses the programmable memory

794
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,880
to store the instructions and to

795
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,560
implement the functions such as

796
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:55,599
logic sequencing timing counting

797
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:58,240
and arithmetic words to control the

798
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,200
machines

799
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,480
and processes so i want i would like to

800
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,480
emphasize here that

801
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,280
these are very general these these

802
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:07,839
functions

803
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:09,760
are very general they are there in the

804
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,200
microprocessor

805
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,240
in microcomputer and in microcontroller

806
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,359
as well

807
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:19,359
but when we use these technology

808
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:23,040
especially to control the machines

809
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,160
and the processes then we then we

810
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,960
we are calling that device as the

811
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,160
programmable logic controller

812
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,960
a schematic of the arrangement of

813
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,320
various elements

814
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:41,040
of plc can be seen on your screen

815
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,640
here you can notice that

816
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,480
the plc has all the typical elements

817
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,960
which are there in a micro computer it

818
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,520
has

819
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:55,760
microprocessor communication

820
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,800
ports communication paths that is a

821
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,760
buses

822
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,440
memory but

823
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:07,359
you just notice that the plc's has

824
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:10,400
a power supply that is supporting the

825
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,119
memory

826
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:13,839
that is assisting the memory and that is

827
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:14,240
also

828
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,440
assisting the microprocessor it has

829
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,000
inbuilt power supply which is helping

830
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,160
the memory and microprocessor to survive

831
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:29,119
the plc's have the input output circuits

832
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:32,240
and dedicated input and industrially

833
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:32,960
hardened

834
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,000
output interfaces

835
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,400
so that the circuitry of the plc will be

836
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,079
safeguarded little more

837
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:46,800
details about the plc's can be seen on

838
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,400
your screen

839
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,720
see it has all the elements

840
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,920
of a typical microprocessor based system

841
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,520
that is cpu the clock

842
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,520
which is controlling the operations of

843
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,280
the cpu

844
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,680
the memory elements such as the

845
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,839
read-only memory

846
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:12,160
random access memory input output units

847
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:15,520
various buses input

848
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,400
system address bus system and the

849
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,280
control bus system

850
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,640
but as i mentioned it has the battery

851
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,680
which is supporting the memory the user

852
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,079
program

853
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,720
memory here

854
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,720
and the important thing is that we are

855
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,440
using

856
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,640
opto isolators in the plc system

857
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:42,320
opto isolators are protecting the plc

858
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,079
from very harsh

859
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:47,440
signals so the input output system

860
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,480
is having a buffer and the buffer is

861
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,560
attached to the opto isolator system

862
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:56,160
if the signals are in acceptable range

863
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,400
they will be buffered in a buffer

864
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,359
register

865
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:02,640
and then the through input output system

866
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,040
bus

867
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,800
it will be communicated inside the

868
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,119
circuitry

869
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:11,520
a typical plc can be seen

870
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,599
a photograph of a typical plc can be

871
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:14,880
seen on your screen

872
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,560
so it has the output

873
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:22,720
relay and input relay output

874
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:27,440
output terminals and input terminals

875
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:34,079
few more pictures of the plcs can be

876
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:36,079
seen on your screen

877
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:41,599
so this is the mitsubishi fx 1s 20 mr

878
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:43,520
you you can see the construction of the

879
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,560
plc is very rugged very robust

880
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:50,880
only that the interfaces are open to the

881
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,079
external world and the construction is

882
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:57,680
very compact very strong

883
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:00,240
we can collapse together many plcs and

884
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,680
they can be stored

885
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,640
in a in a rack on your screen you can

886
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,200
see

887
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:09,760
a rack with multiple number of plc's are

888
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,680
stored they are stationed

889
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,839
so let us summarize the basic functions

890
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:20,400
of the plcs

891
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,520
the plc is scanning a set of sensor

892
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,480
inputs

893
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,839
very rapidly and repetitively

894
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:30,240
so they are getting the inputs at a very

895
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:30,880
fast

896
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,359
rate and then they evaluate

897
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:38,960
that sensor input they carry out

898
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,839
the logic operations on that and

899
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:42,880
according to

900
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,520
the program written they are generating

901
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:49,839
the output

902
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,520
so where the plc's are being used plcs

903
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,960
are used in

904
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,040
automation in open loop it is a

905
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,640
sequential manner

906
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,680
they are also used in the assembly lines

907
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:05,839
in the industry the plc's has

908
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:08,319
multiple inputs and they do have the

909
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:10,160
multiple outputs

910
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:13,200
so the same plc can be connected to many

911
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,319
equipment

912
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:16,880
with multiple inputs can be taken in

913
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:17,520
inside

914
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,240
and the output can be given to the the

915
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,440
actuators

916
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,880
or the actuation devices

917
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,960
what are the various advantages of plcs

918
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,240
the plc is a very cost effective

919
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:36,000
it is a flexible and it has ability to

920
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,319
use similar system for other processes

921
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:43,440
the plc is not a very dedicated or a

922
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,200
special purpose device it is

923
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,319
general purpose device so as i mentioned

924
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:50,000
it is having multiple inputs and

925
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,440
multiple output

926
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,720
the same plc device can be utilized for

927
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,040
the other processes provided you have to

928
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,920
program it accordingly

929
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:03,040
it has capability to resist the impact

930
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,119
and vibrations

931
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:08,400
it has very good resistance towards

932
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,520
electrical and mechanical noise and it

933
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,480
can be

934
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,440
used in very high temperature so that's

935
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,040
why they are very popular

936
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,520
very important in the automation

937
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,800
industry

938
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,319
well with with this i would like to

939
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:25,920
stop for the introduction to

940
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:29,440
microprocessor technology

941
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,560
fine let us summarize uh this lecture

942
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:33,280
four

943
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,480
friends we have seen the important

944
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,280
building block

945
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,160
of a typical or mechatronics based

946
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,520
automated system

947
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,880
that is microprocessor we have seen its

948
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,079
importance

949
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:48,560
the microprocessor is the brain of the

950
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,640
automatic system

951
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:53,520
we studied the architecture of a

952
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,359
microprocessor

953
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:58,720
we have seen its elements

954
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:02,160
various modules the operations of

955
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:06,839
these modules and elements have been

956
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:09,440
studied

957
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,920
after that we learned about the

958
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,720
microcontroller

959
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,680
the microcontroller its definition and

960
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:18,160
its

961
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,839
its difference with the concept of the

962
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:22,960
microprocessor

963
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,079
then we have also seen the

964
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:27,440
microcomputers

965
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:31,280
its meaning and finally we studied

966
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,400
the plcs that is programmable logic

967
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,599
controllers

968
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:38,880
its elements configuration and operation

969
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,960
in lecture 5 of week 5

970
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,440
we will go ahead with programming

971
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,319
languages

972
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:48,839
which are used in designing of

973
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:50,400
microprocessors

974
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,720
we will have an introduction to the

975
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,839
programming languages

976
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:58,640
