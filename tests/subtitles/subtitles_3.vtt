00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.901
The second electronic component
I want to introduce

2
00:00:03.901 --> 00:00:06.989
you to is called the capacitor.
We're actually

3
00:00:06.989 --> 00:00:10.538
going to make one which we will
use in a circuit.

4
00:00:10.538 --> 00:00:14.417
For this you'll need two pieces
of aluminum foil,

5
00:00:14.417 --> 00:00:19.837
about 50 centimeters or 20
inches long. You'll

6
00:00:19.837 --> 00:00:24.554
need pieces of wax paper or
parchment paper, a

7
00:00:24.554 --> 00:00:32.554
couple of wires and some tape.

8
00:00:32.554 --> 00:00:36.364
The paper needs to be both wider
and longer than

9
00:00:36.364 --> 00:00:39.794
the aluminum foil. So cut the
paper longer, and

10
00:00:39.794 --> 00:00:43.772
then you'll most likely need to
shave just a

11
00:00:43.772 --> 00:00:50.125
centimeter or so off the
aluminum sheets.

12
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.706
Hook a wire up to each piece of
tinfoil. You can

13
00:01:30.706 --> 00:01:34.626
tape it in place if that helps.

14
00:02:41.276 --> 00:02:44.884
Now you want to layer them with
paper on the

15
00:02:44.884 --> 00:02:54.434
bottom, then alternate between
the aluminum foil

16
00:02:54.434 --> 00:03:10.327
and the paper so you get them in
a stack.

17
00:03:10.327 --> 00:03:14.237
Now roll them up as tight as you
can - you can use

18
00:03:14.237 --> 00:03:17.246
a straw in the middle if you
want and you think

19
00:03:17.246 --> 00:03:21.334
that helps. Be very careful not
to let the metal

20
00:03:21.334 --> 00:03:38.959
sheets touch anywhere.

21
00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.529
Use a piece of tape to hold

22
00:03:42.529 --> 00:03:56.969
it all together, with the wires
sticking out

23
00:03:56.969 --> 00:04:09.124
the one end.

24
00:04:09.124 --> 00:04:12.014
So you have two sheets of metal,
really really

25
00:04:12.014 --> 00:04:16.310
close to each other, but
separated by an insulator.

26
00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.789
congratulations, you just made a
capacitor.

27
00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:25.325
You're probably wondering "Dude
- what on earth?

28
00:04:25.325 --> 00:04:28.116
Why did you have me make this
completely useless

29
00:04:28.116 --> 00:04:30.482
piece of scrap materials?"

30
00:04:30.482 --> 00:04:35.290
Here's how they work. If we hook
that capacitor up

31
00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.334
to a battery,

32
00:04:48.959 --> 00:05:01.638
Here's our two plates, insulated apart from each other.

33
00:05:01.638 --> 00:05:08.000
electrons will rush out of the
negative post of the

34
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.917
battery and pour onto the
aluminum foil. The

35
00:05:12.917 --> 00:05:18.141
electrons can't get to the other
side because of

36
00:05:18.141 --> 00:05:24.741
the wax paper. However,
electrons repel each other.

37
00:05:24.741 --> 00:05:29.314
They repel like charges. So, all
of these electrons

38
00:05:29.314 --> 00:05:32.434
pouring onto the aluminum foil
are really close to

39
00:05:32.434 --> 00:05:35.601
the other piece of aluminum
foil, so the electrons

40
00:05:35.601 --> 00:05:43.331
are repelled off of that
aluminum - they are also

41
00:05:43.331 --> 00:05:51.000
sucked into the positive pole on
the battery.

42
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.816
So you wind up with a whole pile of electron holes.

43
00:05:57.816 --> 00:06:03.785
So, if you were to graph the
current flow, it would

44
00:06:03.785 --> 00:06:10.681
look something like this: there
would be a spike of

45
00:06:10.681 --> 00:06:16.065
current, which quickly drops to
zero as the foil

46
00:06:16.065 --> 00:06:20.201
fills up and the electrons can't
get across. The

47
00:06:20.201 --> 00:06:23.769
bigger the surface area, the
larger and longer the

48
00:06:23.769 --> 00:06:26.673
current spike will be because
you can fit more

49
00:06:26.673 --> 00:06:30.793
electrons onto the plate - the
aluminum foil. Once

50
00:06:30.793 --> 00:06:33.673
the current has stopped and
we've stuffed as many

51
00:06:33.673 --> 00:06:37.633
electrons on there as we can, if
we were to measure

52
00:06:37.633 --> 00:06:40.067
the voltage across the
capacitor, it would be the

53
00:06:40.067 --> 00:06:43.801
same voltage as the battery that
charged it.

54
00:06:43.801 --> 00:06:46.857
Now, let's reverse the battery
and hook it

55
00:06:46.857 --> 00:06:51.534
up again.

56
00:06:51.534 --> 00:06:54.912
Because you already charged the
capacitor, the

57
00:06:54.912 --> 00:07:00.372
electrons will rush onto what
WAS the positive

58
00:07:00.372 --> 00:07:05.131
plate in the capacitor, and
repel the electrons on

59
00:07:05.131 --> 00:07:08.500
the other plate, which also get
sucked into the

60
00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:16.167
positive pole on the battery.{R15In00Wh]

61
00:07:29.167 --> 00:07:30.943
So again, if we were

62
00:07:30.943 --> 00:07:36.151
to map it, we would get a spike
of current which

63
00:07:36.151 --> 00:07:43.781
quickly dropped to zero. In this
case, just because

64
00:07:43.781 --> 00:07:46.759
we had already charged the
plates, we'd probably

65
00:07:46.759 --> 00:07:49.800
get a spike of current about
double the first time

66
00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:54.703
we ran it. But, if we reverse
the battery again, we

67
00:07:54.703 --> 00:07:57.194
wouldn't get a higher current
spike than

68
00:07:57.194 --> 00:08:00.167
the second run.

69
00:08:00.167 --> 00:08:04.689
So, from this we can see that DC
- Direct Current -cannot pass

70
00:08:04.689 --> 00:08:11.058
through the capacitor - it gets
blocked.

71
00:08:11.058 --> 00:08:14.283
However, let's hook electricity
up to this

72
00:08:14.283 --> 00:08:19.542
capacitor, and while the
electrons are rushing onto

73
00:08:19.542 --> 00:08:25.873
that plate,
In that

74
00:08:25.873 --> 00:08:30.123
that split second before the
electron flow drops to

75
00:08:30.123 --> 00:08:33.081
nothing, what happens if we
suddenly reverse the

76
00:08:33.081 --> 00:08:36.545
polarity of the electricity?

77
00:08:36.545 --> 00:08:41.417
For that matter, let's hook up
AC to it. The

78
00:08:41.417 --> 00:08:45.375
electrons would rush onto the
plate, before the electrons

79
00:08:45.375 --> 00:08:48.903
have a chance to fill up the
plate and stop pouring onto

80
00:08:48.903 --> 00:08:52.073
it, we reverse the polarity of
the electricity,

81
00:08:52.073 --> 00:08:55.444
which pours electrons back onto
the second plate

82
00:08:55.444 --> 00:08:58.339
and sucks them off the first, at
which point we

83
00:08:58.339 --> 00:09:00.658
reverse it again.

84
00:09:00.658 --> 00:09:02.907
If we were to graph it, the
current would look

85
00:09:02.907 --> 00:09:10.167
something like this:

86
00:09:10.167 --> 00:09:17.242
So this is the key: Capacitors
block DC but allow

87
00:09:17.242 --> 00:09:21.925
AC to pass through them. That is
what a capacitor

88
00:09:21.925 --> 00:09:26.876
does. The faster the alternating
current, the

89
00:09:26.876 --> 00:09:32.792
easier it passes through the
capacitor. Basically,

90
00:09:32.792 --> 00:09:38.042
the faster the AC, the sooner it reverses polarity,

91
00:09:38.042 --> 00:09:45.167
before the electron flow starts to slow down.

92
00:09:45.167 --> 00:09:49.000
So the larger the plates, the
easier it is

93
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.167
the easier it is for
AC to pass through

94
00:09:53.167 --> 00:09:57.632
and also the
capacitance is bigger. It's

95
00:09:57.632 --> 00:10:01.375
capacity is bigger.

96
00:10:01.375 --> 00:10:06.398
Now if we hook up the capacitor
to DC, let it

97
00:10:06.398 --> 00:10:11.110
charge up the plates and then
remove the battery,

98
00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:15.326
the capacitor does store that
charge. There's an

99
00:10:15.326 --> 00:10:18.491
excess of electrons on one plate
while the other

100
00:10:18.491 --> 00:10:23.427
plate has been sucked dry of
electrons. The air and

101
00:10:23.427 --> 00:10:31.036
the wax paper both have really
high resistance, but

102
00:10:31.036 --> 00:10:36.777
it's not infinite. So over time
the electrons will

103
00:10:36.777 --> 00:10:40.804
manage to leak over to the other
side and balance

104
00:10:40.804 --> 00:10:46.557
it out, losing its stored
charge. But capacitors

105
00:10:46.557 --> 00:10:49.700
can be used to store a charge -
though usually that

106
00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:52.355
is not what they are used for.
